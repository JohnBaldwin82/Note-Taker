## Description
Modifying starter code to be able to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to save and write notes. 
This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, 
and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## Usage
Please click on get started to navigate to your note taker. Once on the Note Taker page enter in your Note Title and then
your Note text. Once this is entered a saved button will appear. Click on the save button to save your Note.
